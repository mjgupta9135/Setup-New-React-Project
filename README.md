# React Project Setup Guide with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Routing

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a React project using Vite, integrate Tailwind CSS, configure routing, and run the application.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 7 or higher)

---

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Create a New Project

Start by creating a new React project using Vite. Run the command `npm create vite@latest` and follow the prompts to configure the project. Navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies.

### 2. Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and its required dependencies using npm. Then, initialize the Tailwind configuration to generate a `tailwind.config.js` file.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS

Edit the `tailwind.config.js` file to include all source files for your project. This ensures Tailwind scans the appropriate files for class usage.

### 4. Add Tailwind to CSS

Add the necessary Tailwind directives to the project's main CSS file. This will include the base, components, and utilities styles from Tailwind.

### 5. Modify the Entry File

Update the `main.jsx` file to set up routing and render the root component of your application.

### 6. Set Up Routing

Create a custom hook to define and manage your app's routes. Use React Router to configure a layout component and nested routes for different pages.

### 7. Run the Project

Start the development server using `npm run dev`. Open the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser to see the running application.
